# hack-a-thing-2-blockchainimplementation

What we used:
We followed a tutorial from the above URL to implement a data structure in Python. We used
jupyter notebook and a few Python built-in libraries to build a basic blockchain data structure
and perform basic financial transactions using it.


What we attempted to build:
A simple implementation of blockchain t o understand how they work and how they can be applied to other types.
We attempted to simulate a number of valid transactions that can be done through blockchain.

Who did what:
Steven - Implemented structures for basic transactions, building the blockchain, and
Arun - Implemented structures for checking chain validity & putting the rest together & testing

What we learned:
We learned how to implement simple blockchain data structures and utilize appropriate Python libraries
to perform necessary, secure financial transactions.


How does this hack-a-thing inspire you or relate to your possible project ideas?:
We can now build a fintech app/website that utilizes blockchain. We can also try building
other apps that involve transaction platforms by using blockchain.

What didnâ€™t work:
It was difficult to understand how the transactions worked.
